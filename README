                               OPEN FLOW MANAGER

==================================================================================

OpenFlowManager is a network visualization and management web/mobile 
application built on OpenFlow protocol.

This application is built using GTMob development framework of Georgia Tech 
and is not intended to run on any other framework.

However, the code could be modified easily to make it run on a normal web server.

The application uses following web technologies:

1. HTML5
2. JavaScript
3. JQuery
4. JQuery Mobile
5. CSS
6. AJAX
7. PHP

The application consumes REST APIs provided by "floodlight" which is a
Java based openflow controller developed by BigSwitch Inc.

I have added my own APIs to the original code of "floodlight" and you can 
download a forked branch from my other repository.
